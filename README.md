# 3D-Scene-Loading

For this project I loaded and rendered data that is read from several scene files by completing I/O operations. A “scene” is just a group of data necessary to render a particular thing—this could be a level in a video game, a menu screen, or maybe a shot from an animated movie.

**Key features**:
* All models present in a scene, in the correct position
* All lights loaded and used
* Scene class implemented
* Can switch between two different scenes
